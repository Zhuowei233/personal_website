Hi, I’m Zhuowei Deng, a senior at UCLA, majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics of Computation. I have a strong passion for data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling, and I am always eager to explore how data can be used to solve real-world problems.

I was born and raised in China and immigrated to the United States when I was 12 years old. My family settled in San Francisco, where I spent my middle school and high school years. Before coming to UCLA, I knew I wanted to study something related to mathematics — it had always been my favorite subject. However, my interest in statistics specifically developed after taking AP Statistics in high school. Wanting to study both math and statistics, with a bit of computer science to enhance my analytical skills, I decided to pursue a double major in these fields.

Beyond academics, I actively contribute to Bruin Women in Business, where I serve as an Event Committee Logistic Manager. In this role, I oversee event operations, including logistics, speaker coordination, and participant outreach for major professional networking events such as the Aspiring Businesswomen Summit. This experience has helped me develop strong project management, organizational, and leadership skills. 

Outside of my studies, I love traveling and exploring new cuisines—Thai food is my favorite! I enjoy trying different dishes and discovering hidden gems in different cities. I also have a passion for movies, and my all-time favorite film is The Shawshank Redemption.

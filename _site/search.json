    "text": "Hi, Iâ€™m Zhuowei Deng, a senior at UCLA, majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics of Computation. I have a strong passion for data science, machine learning, and statistical modeling, and I am always eager to explore how data can be used to solve real-world problems.\nI was born and raised in China before immigrating to the United States at 12, where my family settled in San Francisco. Throughout middle and high school, mathematics was always my favorite subject, but it wasnâ€™t until I took AP Statistics that I discovered my passion for uncovering patterns and insights through data. Fascinated by how statistics transforms raw data into meaningful information for informed decision-making, I decided to pursue a double major at UCLA, integrating computer science to further enhance my analytical skills.\nAt UCLA, I work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for Physics 1A: Mechanics, where I support two discussion sections (~60+ students) by answering questions and guiding problem-solving during worksheets. I meet weekly with TAs to review materials and ensure discussions are structured for effective student engagement. This experience has strengthened my teaching, communication, and problem-solving skills. I also serve as an Event Committee Logistics Manager for Bruin Women in Business (BWIB), helping coordinate event logistics and outreach for professional networking events such as the Aspiring Businesswomen Summit.\nOutside of my studies, I love traveling and exploring new cuisinesâ€”Thai food is my favorite! I also have a passion for movies, and my all-time favorite film is The Shawshank Redemption.\n\n\nMoments & Memories\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 BWIB ABS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCLA Spirit - Posing with Joe Bruin\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Adventure - Meeting a Husky"
